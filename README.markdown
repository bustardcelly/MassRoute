# About

MassRoute is an Android application that consumes real-time transit data from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. 
Using MassRoute, you check when the next bus will be arriving at your stop.

Roughly, this project started out as a vehicle for learning the ins-and-outs of Android. So, things may not look pretty from time to time but will work. It's up here for those that may be curious as how to do some things in Android and/or those savvy enough to build it and put it on their Android device freely.

# SDK

Built against the Android 2.2 SDK.
